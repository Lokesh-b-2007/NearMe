                 It stands as one of the 108 Divya Desams, the sacred abodes of Vishnu celebrated in the works of the Alvars. The temple showcases magnificent Dravidian architecture, featuring towering gopurams, intricately carved pillars, and a sacred tank named Anantha Theertham.
                  A unique aspect of the temple is the wooden idol of Varadharaja Perumal, made from the fig tree (Atthi), which is brought out for worship once every 40 years and kept immersed in water otherwise. The temple is also notable for its association with the philosopher Ramanuja, who is believed to have resided here.</font>
